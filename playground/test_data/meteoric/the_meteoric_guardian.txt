You truly are a special child, Alex. You've always been so much more than we could ever comprehend.

I understand, Mother and Father. But I promise to control myself and use my gifts responsibly.

(Smugly)
Give us your valuables, and we might let you go.

(Trembling)
Please, we don't have anything of value.

(Alex's eyes flare with determination as he stands up, knowing he must intervene.)

(Quietly to himself)
Time to reveal the Meteoric Guardian within me.

(Comforting)
Alex, you are our son, and we love you no matter what. We found you in that cosmic storm, and you're a gift to us, no matter where you came from.

ALEX:
(Frustrated)
Not again...

We don't need a reason to mess with you pretty girls.

(With a small smile)
Call me Alex. I'm just someone who can't stand seeing innocent people bullied.
